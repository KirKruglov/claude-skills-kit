# user-feedback-synthesizer

Turn a folder of interview transcripts, support tickets, and survey files into a structured insight report — without spending two days tagging and clustering manually.

---

## What It Does

`user-feedback-synthesizer` reads your feedback files (`.md`, `.txt`, `.csv`) and produces a single report with:

- **Themes ranked by frequency** — how many sources mention each topic
- **Verbatim quotes** as evidence per theme
- **Prioritized insights** table (High / Medium / Low by source count)
- **Open questions** — gaps, conflicting signals, single-source findings worth investigating

The output file `feedback-insights-YYYY-MM-DD.md` is ready to share with your team or paste into a planning doc.

---

## Requirements

- One or more feedback files in `.md`, `.txt`, or `.csv` format
- Files should contain user interview transcripts, support ticket exports, survey responses, or any freeform feedback text
- `.csv` files need a header row; content column will be auto-detected

## Examples

**Example 1 — Analyze a folder of interview transcripts**

> "Synthesize feedback from interviews/ folder"

Claude reads all `.md` and `.txt` files in `interviews/`, clusters themes, and outputs:
- 5 themes ranked by frequency
- Top quotes per theme
- Prioritized insights table
- Open questions based on gaps and conflicting signals

**Example 2 — Survey CSV with a research question**

> "User feedback report from q1-survey.csv — focus on checkout experience"

Claude reads `q1-survey.csv`, extracts signals related to checkout, surfaces themes from survey responses, and flags insights and open questions specific to that flow.
